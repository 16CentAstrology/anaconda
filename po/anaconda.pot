"You have chosen to manually set up the filesystems for your new "
"%(productName)s installation. Before you begin, you might want to take a "
"minute to learn the lay of the land. Quite a bit has changed.\n"
"\n"
"The most important change is that creation of new filesystems has been "
"streamlined. You no longer have to build complex devices like LVM logical "
"volumes in stages (physical volume, then volume group, then logical volume) "
"-- now you just create a logical volume and we'll handle the legwork of "
"setting up the physical volumes and volume group to contain it. We'll also "
"handle adjusting the volume group as you add, remove, and resize logical "
"volumes so you don't have to worry about the mundane details.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Screen Layout\n"
"\n"
"The left-hand side of the screen shows the OS installations we were able to "
"find on this computer. The new %(productName)s installation is at the top of "
"the list. You can click on the names of the installations to see what "
"filesystems they contain.\n"
"\n"
"Below the various installations and mountpoints on the left-hand side there "
"are buttons to add a new filesystem, remove the selected filesystem, or "
"configure the selected filesystem.\n"
"\n"
"The right-hand side of the screen is where you can customize the currently-"
"selected mountpoint.\n"
"\n"
"On the bottom-left you will see a summary of the disks you have chosen to "
"use for the installation. You can click on the blue text to see more "
"detailed information about your selected disks.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How to create a new filesystem on a new device\n"
"\n"
"1. Click on the + button.\n"
"2. Enter the mountpoint and size. (Hint: Hover the mouse pointer over either "
"of the text entry areas for help.)\n"
"3. Select the new mountpoint under \"New %(productName)s Installation\" on "
"the left-hand side of the screen and customize it to suit your needs.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How to reformat a device/filesystem that already exists on your disk\n"
"\n"
"1. Select the filesystem from the left-hand side of the screen.\n"
"2. Click on the \"Customize\" expander in the mountpoint customization area "
"on the right-hand side of the screen.\n"
"3. Activate the \"Reformat\" checkbutton, select a filesystem type and, if "
"applicable, enter a mountpoint above in the \"Mountpoint\" text entry area.\n"
"4. Click on \"Apply changes\"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How to set a mountpoint for a filesystem that already exists on your disk\n"
"\n"
"1. Select the filesystem from the left-hand side of the screen.\n"
"2. Enter a mountpoint in the \"Mountpoint\" text entry area in the "
"mountpoint customization area.\n"
"3. Click on \"Apply changes\"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"How to remove a filesystem that already exists on your disk\n"
"\n"
"1. Select the filesystem you wish to remove on the left-hand side of the "
"screen.\n"
"2. Click the - button.\n"
"\n"
"Hint: Removing a device that already exists on your disk from the \"New "
"%(productName)s Installation\" does not remove it from the disk. It only "
"resets that device to its original state. To remove a device that already "
"exists on your disk, you must select it from under any of the other detected "
"installations (or \"Unknown\") and hit the - button.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Tips and hints\n"
"\n"
"You can enter sizes for new filesystems that are greater than the total "
"available free space. The installer will come as close as possible to the "
"size you request.\n"
"\n"
"By default, new devices use any/all of your selected disks.\n"
"\n"
"You can change which disks a new device may be allocated from by clicking "
"the configure button (the one with a tools graphic) while that device is "
"selected.\n"
"\n"
"When adding a new mountpoint by clicking the + button, leave the size entry "
"blank to make the new device use all available free space.\n"
"\n"
"When you remove the last device from a container device like an LVM volume "
"group, we will automatically remove that container device to make room for "
"new devices.\n"
"\n"
"When the last partition is removed from a disk, that disk may be "
"reinitialized with a new partition table if we think there is a more "
"appropriate type for that disk.\n"
