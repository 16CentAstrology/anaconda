+ Add "Add custom repo..." dialog.
- Can the entry next to "Closest Mirror" be filled in with something to make it look less weird?
- Disk tug-o-war needs to be written.
- Do the really slow redraws happen on real hardware, or just virt?
- Install hub needs to be skipped if all spokes are completed on a kickstart install.
  How to handle the fact that spokes may only be ready once they're finished downloading?
- Network spoke needs apply method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- NetworkStandaloneSpoke needs completed method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Need to sort out checking of storage config against package set space needs.
- Reword "Continue" button on Install Destination confirmation to give a better indicator of
  where you go next.
- Something causes the up and down arrows to resize the anaconda window.
- Test handling of inconsistent LVM/RAID, and uninitialized disks.
- The Install Destination "Back" button is the only one that cancels everything instead of
  applies.  Do something about this.
+ Update exception handling.  This requires updating python-meh to use gtk3,
  which also requires updating firstboot and s-c-ks to gtk3.  I want to turn
  s-c-ks into an anaconda wrapper first, though.
- Wall of anaconda needs to be taken into account.
- Why does the first hub jump left a little bit the first time you use the keyboard to navigate?
