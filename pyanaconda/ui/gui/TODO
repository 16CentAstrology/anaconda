- Add a base class with kill switch for check threads (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Copy screenshots over to finished system.
- Hubs need a way of noticing check threads are running (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Test handling of inconsistent LVM/RAID, and uninitialized disks.
- Update exception handling.  This requires updating python-meh to use gtk3,
  which also requires updating firstboot and s-c-ks to gtk3.  I want to turn
  s-c-ks into an anaconda wrapper first, though.
