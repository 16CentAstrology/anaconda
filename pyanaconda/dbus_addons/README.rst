Why the addons folder ?
=======================

This is just a folder for temporary example addons.
Normally addons will be distributed in separate packages
and their source code will not be part of the Anaconda
source code repository.

Addons also might not even be written in Python, they just
need to conform to the DBUS interface specification.
