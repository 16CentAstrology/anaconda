- Add a base class with kill switch for check threads (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Add "Add custom repo..." dialog.
- Disk tug-o-war needs to be written.
- Do the really slow redraws happen on real hardware, or just virt?
- Hubs need a way of noticing check threads are running (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Install hub needs to be skipped if all spokes are completed on a kickstart install.
  How to handle the fact that spokes may only be ready once they're finished downloading?
- Network spoke needs apply method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- NetworkStandaloneSpoke needs completed method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Need to sort out checking of storage config against package set space needs.
- Port hand cursor to MountpointSelectors.
- Tabbing behavior in the Accordion is weird.
- Test handling of inconsistent LVM/RAID, and uninitialized disks.
- There are three different free space displays - on lower left of install destination, on
  disk shopping cart, and on lower left of custom partition.  They're all different.  Which
  is correct?
- Update exception handling.  This requires updating python-meh to use gtk3,
  which also requires updating firstboot and s-c-ks to gtk3.  I want to turn
  s-c-ks into an anaconda wrapper first, though.
- Wall of anaconda needs to be taken into account.
- The Welcome spoke appears to show back up after you click through betanag.
- When a SpokeSelector or MountpointSelector is clicked on, highlight it in blue just like
  if it were navigated to with the keyboard.
- Why does the first hub jump left a little bit the first time you use the keyboard to navigate?
