Fedora 18
=========
+ Add "Add custom repo..." dialog.
- Add simple keyboard layout selection to welcome language screen.
- Can the entry next to "Closest Mirror" be filled in with something to make it look less weird?
- Disk tug-o-war needs to be written.
- Do the really slow redraws happen on real hardware, or just virt?
- Media install selectors take up all horizontal space on source spoke.
- Network spoke needs apply method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- NetworkStandaloneSpoke needs completed method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Need to sort out checking of storage config against package set space needs.
- Reword "Continue" button on Install Destination confirmation to give a better indicator of
  where you go next.
- The setting on the welcome screen does not get reflected on the language and keyboard spokes.
- Something causes the up and down arrows to resize the anaconda window.
- Some interactive install defaults are different from kickstart (firstboot, ?).  These need to
  be loaded somewhere up front for an interactive install.
+ Update exception handling.  This requires updating python-meh to use gtk3,
  which also requires updating firstboot and s-c-ks to gtk3.  I want to turn
  s-c-ks into an anaconda wrapper first, though.
- Wall of anaconda needs to be taken into account.
- Why does the first hub jump left a little bit the first time you use the keyboard to navigate?
- We need a way for users to look at the list of problems resulting from the
  software dependency check and the storage sanity check
- In custom storage, it'd be nice to be able to say something like "Use this
  previous installation as the starting storage configuration for the system
  I'm installing now"
- In custom storage, it'd be really nice to be able to drag entries from old
  roots into the "New Fedora" root as a way of saying "Use this device with
  the same mountpoint in the new system."

Beyond
======
- "Choose Disks" dialog before hub #1.
- Device filtering.
- Write out in-progress install to kickstart file, detect it on restart
