"volumes in stages (physical volume, then volume group, then logical volume) "
"-- now you just create a logical volume and we'll handle the legwork of "
"setting up the physical volumes and volume group to contain it. We'll also "
"handle adjusting the volume group as you add, remove, and resize logical "
"volumes so you don't have to worry about the mundane details.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Screen Layout\n"
"\n"
"The left-hand side of the screen shows the OS installations we were able to "
"find on this computer. The new %(productName)s installation is at the top of "
"the list. You can click on the names of the installations to see what "
"filesystems they contain.\n"
"\n"
"Below the various installations and mountpoints on the left-hand side there "

"The right-hand side of the screen is where you can customize the currently-"

"\n"

"How to create a new filesystem on a new device\n"
"\n"
"1. Click on the + button.\n"
"2. Enter the mountpoint and size. (Hint: Hover the mouse pointer over either "
"of the text entry areas for help.)\n"
"3. Select the new mountpoint under \"New %(productName)s Installation\" on "

"By default, new devices use any/all of your selected disks.\n"
"\n"
"You can change which disks a new device may be allocated from by clicking "

"\n"
"When adding a new mountpoint by clicking the + button, leave the size entry "

"When you remove the last device from a container device like an LVM volume "
