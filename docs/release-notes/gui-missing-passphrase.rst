:Type: Kickstart
:Summary: Ask for a missing passphrase in GUI

:Description:
    If the kickstart file defines a partitioning that requires a passphrase, the graphical
    user interface shows a dialog that allows users to provide the missing passphrase.
    The installation automatically continues after the passphrase is provided. It works
    the same way in the text user interface.
