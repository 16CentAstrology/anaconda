nomount
Don't automatically mount any installed Linux partitions in rescue mode.

updates
Path to an updates image that is on local filesystem or available over FTP or HTTP.
UPDATES_URL must be either a local filesystem path, a network URL or <disk>:<path> where
<disk> can be one of sdX, /dev/sdX, LABEL=xxx, UUID=xxx and <path> defaults
to /updates.img if missing. See the Anaconda docs for more details about the path specification.
Please note that the updates image only updates the installation environment and is completely
unrelated to package updates.

dirinstall
Use the device mounted at /mnt/sysimage as the installation
destination. The --dirinstall and --image options are mutually
exclusive. The /mnt/sysimage directory can be overridden by
setting the ANACONDA_ROOT_PATH environmental variable before
starting anaconda.

image
Specification of disk image file to be used as installation
destination. IMAGE_SPEC must have format <path>[:<name>] where
<path> specifies the path of an image file and an optional <name>
component is used to identify the disk during installation.
<path> must be a local path but it may be relative or absolute.
If <name> is not specified, a name is synthesized from the
basename of <path>. <name> may not contain a colon or a slash.
This option may be used multiple times to specify multiple disk
images. It is an error to specify the same <path> twice or to use
duplicate names. The --image and --dirinstall options are
mutually exclusive.

memcheck
Check if the system has enough RAM to complete the installation
and abort if it doesn't. Please note that this check is approximate
and that memory usage during installation depends on the package
selection, user interface (graphical vs text) and other parameters.

nomemcheck
Do not check if the system has enough RAM to complete the installation.
Of course, any attempt to install with less than the safe minimum amount
of memory may fail and is unsupported.

leavebootorder
Boot the drives in their existing order, to override the default of booting
into the newly installed drive on Power Systems servers and EFI systems.
This is useful for systems that, for example, should network boot first
before falling back to a local boot.

noeject
Don't eject the installation CD/DVD (if any) once the installation
has been completed. Ignored for image, directory and livecd installs.

extlinux
Use extlinux as the bootloader. Note that there's no attempt to validate
that this will work for your platform or anything; it assumes that if you
ask for it, you want to try.

dnf
Use the experimental DNF package management backend instead of the YUM backend
that is used by default. For more information about the DNF project see:
http://dnf.baseurl.org
