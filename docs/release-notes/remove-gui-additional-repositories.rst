:Summary: Remove support for additional repositories from GUI

:Description:
    The widget that allowed users to specify and edit additional repositories for the package
    installation was removed from the "Installation Source" screen of the GTK-based graphical
    user interface. Use the kickstart support or the ``inst.addrepo`` boot option to specify
    additional repositories.
