Fedora 18
=========
- Add simple keyboard layout selection to welcome language screen.
- Add keyboard options dialog.
- Can the entry next to "Closest Mirror" be filled in with something to make it look less weird?
- Disk tug-o-war needs to be written.
- Do the really slow redraws happen on real hardware, or just virt?
- Fix ransom notes cycling.
- Fix retranslating once a different language is selected.
- Fix the big pause between leaving the storage spoke and displaying the hub (needs error handling
  pushed first).
- Live inst in particular needs a more useful installation progress bar.
- Make "Add custom repo..." dialog useful.
- Media install selectors take up all horizontal space on source spoke.
- Network spoke needs apply method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- NetworkStandaloneSpoke needs completed method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Need to sort out checking of storage config against package set space needs.
- Reword "Back" button on spokes to say something more about how we're applying changes and
  going back to the hub.
- Reword "Continue" button on Install Destination confirmation to give a better indicator of
  where you go next.
- Wall of anaconda needs to be taken into account.
- Why does the first hub jump left a little bit the first time you use the keyboard to navigate?
  Software selection also does this.
- In custom storage, it'd be nice to be able to say something like "Use this
  previous installation as the starting storage configuration for the system
  I'm installing now"
- In custom storage, it'd be really nice to be able to drag entries from old
  roots into the "New Fedora" root as a way of saying "Use this device with
  the same mountpoint in the new system."
- We're probably going to need to update the auto-generated names of container
  devices any time the user updates the hostname.

Beyond
======
- "Choose Disks" dialog before hub #1.
- Device filtering.
- Write out in-progress install to kickstart file, detect it on restart
