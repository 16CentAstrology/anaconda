:Type: User interfaces
:Summary: Remove all support of the built-in help system

:Description:
    The support of the built-in help accessible from spokes and hubs of all user interfaces
    is removed. The ``help_directory`` Anaconda configuration option is deprecated and removed.
    The ``anaconda-user-help`` package will be deprecated and removed.

    Anaconda will aim to make user interfaces self-descriptive and encourage users to use the
    official documentation of specific Linux distributions available on-line.
