                installation regardless of installation method.

		installation.

driverdisk      Same as 'dd'.

		    - prompts for driver disk

graphical	Force graphical install. Required to have ftp/http use GUI.

isa             Prompt user for ISA devices configuration.

ip=<ip>		IP to use for a network installation, use 'dhcp' for DHCP.

ks=cdrom:       Kickstart from CDROM

ks=file:<path>  Kickstart from a file (path = 'fd0/ks.cfg')

ks=ftp://<path> Kickstart from FTP.

ks=hd:<dev>     Kickstart via harddrive (dev = 'hda1', for example)

ksdevice        Takes one of 4 types of argument which tells install
                what network device to use for kickstart from network:

		- An argument like 'eth0' naming a specific interface
		- An argument like 00:12:34:56:78:9a indicating the
		  MAC address of a specific interface
		- The keyword `link' indicating that the first
		  interface with link up
		- The keyword `bootif' indicating that the MAC address
		  indicated by the BOOTIF command line option will be
		  used to locate the boot interface. BOOTIF is
		  automagically supplied by pxelinux when you include
		  the option `IPAPPEND 2' in your pxelinux.cfg file

kssendmac	Adds HTTP headers to ks=http:// request that can be helpful
                for provisioning systems.  Includes MAC address of all
                network interfaces in HTTP headers of the form:

method=hd://<dev>/<path> Use <path> on <dev> for a hard drive installation

method=http://<path> Use <path> for an HTTP installation

method=nfs:<path> Use <path> for an NFS installation.

mtu=<num>       Set the MTU (maximum transmission unit) used during
