- Add a base class with kill switch for check threads (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Add "Add custom repo..." dialog.
- Custom partitioning needs to be revisited, then written.
- Disk tug-o-war needs to be written.
- Hubs need a way of noticing check threads are running (561185b0a8c2e7aaf4a9a8b551bab394116430a8).
- Install hub needs to be skipped if all spokes are completed on a kickstart install.
  How to handle the fact that spokes may only be ready once they're finished downloading?
- Language spoke off the first hub needs to be written.
- Network spoke needs apply method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- NetworkStandaloneSpoke needs completed method and to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Pressing Continue on the partitioning screen can result in a long pause if package metadata is
  still being downloaded (waiting for lock).
- Storage spoke needs to look at ksdata when setting itself up.
- Test handling of inconsistent LVM/RAID, and uninitialized disks.
- Translations don't work, especially not for strings with "%s" in them.
- Update exception handling.  This requires updating python-meh to use gtk3,
  which also requires updating firstboot and s-c-ks to gtk3.  I want to turn
  s-c-ks into an anaconda wrapper first, though.
- Wall of anaconda needs to be taken into account.
